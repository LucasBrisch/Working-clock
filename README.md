⏰ The Working Clock ☀️🌙
Welcome to the Working Clock, a charming and dynamic timepiece crafted with React and the Canvas API! This project goes beyond a simple clock, bringing the rhythm of day and night directly to your browser. Watch as the sun and moon gracefully orbit the clock face, mirroring the real-world time.

✨ Project Overview
This clock isn't just about telling time; it's about making time a visual journey! Developed as a college project for my HTML5 - Canvas & Games subject, it elegantly combines React's component-based architecture with the power of the Canvas API. It's a delightful demonstration of how modern front-end frameworks can create something both functional and aesthetically pleasing, managing the animation and state of the sun and moon with ease.

🌟 Key Features
Real-time Synchronization: The clock precisely matches your computer's current time, down to the second.
Dynamic Day/Night Cycle: Observe a friendly sun ☀️ and a serene moon 🌙 that rotate around the clock, visually representing the time of day.
Built with React: Leverages React's declarative UI for efficient component management and state handling of the clock and its celestial companions.
Canvas API Powered: Utilizes the robust Canvas API (accessed via the <canvas> HTML element) for drawing and animating the clock face and its moving elements.
Clean & Simple Aesthetics: A straightforward design that puts the animated elements at the forefront.
